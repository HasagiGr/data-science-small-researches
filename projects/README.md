## Project_1 - Intro in Data Science with titanic
This project is entry point to data analysys and data science.\
Task: predict if the passanger on titanic survived (binary classification).\
Learn how to:
- download the data from Kaggle;
- get first look at data and fill missing values;
- build graphs to undestrand correlations;
- prepare dataset to fit to models;
- use sklearn models;
- use cross validation and confusion matrix to undestand model itself and it's effectiveness;
- fine-tune hyperparameters;
- interprete model, using shap lib.

[Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) was used.

## Project_2 - Student's dropout or success
This project aim is to use ML algorithms and guidelines i've learned.\
Task: predict if student will  dropout or succeed or remain enrolled(multi-classifications).\
Learn how to:
- use pivot tables;
- use PCA decomposition;
- choose most important features;
- choose best models due to specifics of data;
- try different approaches to blend models.

Ideas to realize:
- feed probas of different models as input data to NN.

[Predict students' dropout and academic success dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention) was used.
